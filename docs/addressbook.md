# \[Address Book\] EDIT

The address book contains the node ID and and node address information required to sync with Hedera node\(s\) in a specific network.  The **mainnet** address book file ID is `0.0.102`. You can obtain the address book information by requesting the contents of the file `0.0.102` \([`FileContentsQuery()`](file-service-1/get-file-contents.md)\). The network information can also be found in your Hedera portal account.

The **testnet** and **mainnet** address book information is available in the Hedera portal.
