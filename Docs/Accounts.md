Accounts
The account represents your account specific to the Hedera network. Accounts are required to utilize the Hedera network services and to pay network transaction fees. Hedera account IDs have the format: x.y.z. eg 0.0.3. where:
x represents the shard number (shardId). It will default to 0 today, as Hedera only performs in one shard.
y represents the realm number (realmId). It will default to 0 today, as realms are not yet supported.
z represents the account number.
Together these values make up your accountId. When an accountId is requested, be sure all three values are included.
Basic
The easiest way to create an account is using .createAccount(). with the simple client. createAccount() requires two properties, the public key to be associated with the new account and the initial balance in tinybars.
client.setMaxTransactionFee().createAccount(PublicKey, initialBalance);
